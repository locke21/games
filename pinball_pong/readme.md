Instructions: It's Pong! Except with random obstacles and flippers found in pinball machines. First player to 5 wins.


Leftside Player: 
- "w" to move paddle/flippers up. 
- "s" to move paddle/flippers down.
- "d" to prime flippers.

Rightside Player:
- "Up" arrowkey to move paddle/flippers up. 
- "Down" arrowkey to move paddle/flippers down.
- "Left" arrowkey to prime flippers.


Wall Spawns:
- Gold teleports ball to opposite side.
- Green and lightblue manipulates wall spawns.


Changes/Bug fixes 7-26:
- Sometimes ball would enter the speed force, moving so fast that it eventually disappears. Implemented speed checker. 
- Added Flippers instead of standard paddle.
- Fixed issue where ball occasionally gets stuck inside paddles. 
- Fixed issue where ball would get stuck on top wall instead of correctly bouncing.
