Directions:

Left Player: "A" or "S" to move Paddle.
Right PLayer: "UP" or "DOWN" to move Paddle.

Random wall spawns:
  - Green and light_blue manipulates small walls. 
  - Gold teleports ball to opposite opponent corner. 

Quality of life improvements:
  - Ball should try and maintain an acceptable rate. Previously found the ball moved too fast hitting objects, sometimes disappearing with the speed force.
  - Ball should accelerate after hitting paddles to provide more challenge.
  - Randomized start.
